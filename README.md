These MATLAB scripts and Simulink models were developed on one PC to control a Gazebo simulation on a separate PC. With both PCs connected to
the same wifi network, one can communicate via IP address of the ROS/Gazebo PC, using the 'rosinit' command in MATLAB/Simulink. 

The Gazebo simulation (over in the 'darwinsim' repository) is based on the ROS packages from the Generation Robots website:
